Documentation Goals
===================

 * Development documentation
 	What each app does.
 * HOWTO documentation
 	Extend a specific application of helios or helios itself. Add a new app, how to
	integrate it to your own site.
 * User documentation
 	Actually this is intented as admin/manager documents. Explaining how a user can
	work with helios, adding/removing stuff through the admin section.
	This might be extended in the feature. Keep in mind that we should not be lead
	astray from the admin app. Each addition should be done there, and not through
	individual generic or not forms.
